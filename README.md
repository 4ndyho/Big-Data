# Big-Data

Task:
To gain fundamental Python skills required for utilising big data technologies; 
to understand how classical statistical methods are applied in contemporary data analysis; 
to explore the practical applications and recognise the limitations of data analysis tools across various problem domains; 
and to appreciate the complexities and challenges inherent in data analysis.

This project covers Statistical analysis, unsupervised learning (K-Means & Hierarchal Agglomerative Clustering)
& supervised learning (Linear Regression)
